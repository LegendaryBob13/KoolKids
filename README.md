KoolKidsMC Server Priority Issue Support!
If there is an issue that you think is more than a days work please report it here.
This GitHub Page is just for my own organization and will not contain any server files.


If this project goes down and I can no longer support it files will be posted here and on my discord.
If you have a GitHub account I would recommend following this project to stay in the loop. 
If you have any feature requests or bug reports Report them in Discord and on here If you can.
Thank you all for the support to keep KoolKidsMC a reality!
